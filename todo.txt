-- TODO Now --
Add compose to the tutorial.

-- TODO Later --
-- Add documentation.

-- Testing todos:
Fix the arrowheads being too big for SyntaxGraph darwings.

-- Visual todos:
-- Make an icon font/library with labeled ports. E.g. the apply icon would have text labels "function", "result", "arg 0", "arg 1", etc.
-- Don't rotate text and nested icons, give them rectangualar bounding boxes in GraphViz. (Perhaps use a typeclass for isRotateAble)
-- Give lines a black border to make line crossings easier to see.
-- Give lines that cross the border of a lambda function a special color.
-- Line intersections should have a small circle. This could probably be done with
-- a line ending.
-- Let each bool, value pair in Guard icon be flipped to reduce line crossings. Do the same for case.
-- Let lines connect to ports in multiple locations (eg. case value, or guard result)
-- Use different line styles (eg. dashed, solid, wavy) in addition to colors

-- Translate todos:

-- Fix test case x of {0 -> 1; y -> y}.
-- Add proper RecConstr, and RecUpdate support.
-- Eliminate BranchIcon in Alts.
-- Eliminate BranchIcon for the identity funciton "y x = x"
-- Special case for otherwise.
