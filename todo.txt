-- TODO Now --
Put the name and type for top-level-binds in a text box below drawings.
Translate (.) into compose
Make GitHub issues

-- TODO Later --
-- Add documentation.

-- Testing todos:
Fix the arrowheads being too big for SyntaxGraph drawings.

-- Visual todos:
Draw bounding boxes for lambdas (use dashed lines)
Case icon that can embed literals
-- Make an icon font/library with labeled ports. E.g. the apply icon would have text labels "function", "result", "arg 0", "arg 1", etc.
-- Don't rotate text and nested icons, give them rectangular bounding boxes in GraphViz. (Perhaps use a typeclass for isRotateAble)
-- Give lines a black border to make line crossings easier to see.
-- Line intersections should have a small circle. This could probably be done with
-- a line ending.
-- Let each bool, value pair in Guard icon be flipped to reduce line crossings. Do the same for case.
-- Let lines connect to ports in multiple locations (e.g. case value, or guard result)
-- Use different line styles (e.g. dashed, solid, wavy) in addition to colors
Use diagrams to shrink the drawing until icons start overlapping.

-- Translate todos:
Consider adding binding variable names to the lambda icon and match icon. Don't display the name if it is only one character.
Fix applyComposeScore in Translate.hs not counting expressions that nest via reference. May need to move compose generation to after translate.

-- Fix test case x of {0 -> 1; y -> y}.
-- Add proper RecConstr, and RecUpdate support.
-- Eliminate BranchIcon in Alts.
-- Eliminate BranchIcon for the identity function "y x = x"
-- Special case for otherwise.
